	1. single language --> event predicon (e.g.) riot/natural disaster
		news recommender based on financial impact
	2. multi-language ---> consistent embedding or inconsistent arbitrage
	3. difference between transformer and word2vec/seq2seq
		randomly initialized embedding -> contextualize --> the word -> improving embedding

[22-01-30 q to answer]
1. how arbitrage trading
	how is that related to JUn and Allan's paper?
2. how is trading related to signal processing, search google?
	if anything, how is that relted to Alex or Rayan Saab's paper?
3. how is trading related NLP, search google?
	if anything, how is that related to Ndapa and Leon's paper?
4. can you finish the allan work

5. can you buy noodles, toothpaste with extra ingredient
6. can you call home?
7. can you review 200?

[22-01-30 piles to do]
2. interview prep
4. arbitrage thesis --> 
5. nlp 

1. look at target papers and how is it actually done?
	---> AI

	---> nlp trading
	---> (statistical) arbitrage --> signal processing
2. look at prof's intro/paper
	allan timmermann --> arbitrage paper
	jun liu --> arbitrage paper
	
	rayan saab
	
	leon
	ndapa
	
	
	
	
3. generate a basic connection idea and ask prof


[22-01-30 8pm Allan Report]
1. introduction
	efficient market hypothessis
		momentum/value strategy
		what is done in timmermann, indicate what is lacked in those.

2. outline and preliminary testing
	1. outline targeting those 5 points, refer to how it want to analyze things
	2. statistical testing
		1. ARIMAX, why can't we use OLS
		2. Mcnemar


3. experimental results
	1. backtesting
	2. real time testing and comparison of train sample, validation sample and real test sample performance comparison). how result can be intepreted as well here.

4. conclusion and future directions
	conclude on how we satisfactorily make correspondence withrequirement in allan
	but despite those efforts, too weak against market microstructure, and did not fully reject market efficiency due to joint testing. To address these two issues, we list out two research directions.
		NLP
		Statistical arbitrage.

[0Next NLP]
	in actually helping trading, need a prototype to proceed --> i.e. those paper that contain an application example, not just an architecture.
[0Next statistical arbitrage]
	external seek, paper/prof/prof's stu/thesis, and prepare to actually trBde, focus on actually tradable ones if possible

	---> what assumption or intention is the application for?
	---> implementation of networks !!!!!
	---> what kind of analysis needed to be performed !!!!

! mask: 1 if data there, 0 if data not there

? what is the ultimate goal?
? deep learning how to make comparison? accuracy? 


Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing values, Zhengping Che
	(1087/1105)
	(Cited by MRNN as 25, Cited by Naomi as 6, cited by chengxian as Che)

	(focus: assumed missing, GRU-D with masking and time interval (to represent missing chunk)
	
	
	
	
	(opinion on the other side: does not capture the missing data pattern themselves as we impute and downstream model can only see the "full" series)
	(also, extra assumptions, 1. small rate of missing, missing at random, 2. computationally expensive)

		cross_section -- feedforward

	look at code

Use it to predict the type/sector of stock?

time series used: 
1. is it irregular
2. the type of data
