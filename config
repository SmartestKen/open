[22-01-15 7pm Allan Report]
1. introduction
	efficient market hypothessis
		momentum/value strategy
		what is done in timmermann, indicate what is lacked in those.

2. outline and preliminary testing
	1. outline targeting those 5 points, refer to how it want to analyze things
	2. statistical testing
		1. ARIMAX, why can't we use OLS
		2. Mcnemar


3. experimental results
	1. backtesting
	2. real time testing and comparison of train sample, validation sample and real test sample performance comparison). how result can be intepreted as well here.

4. conclusion and future directions
	conclude on how we satisfactorily make correspondence withrequirement in allan
	but despite those efforts, too weak against market microstructure, and did not fully reject market efficiency due to joint testing. To address these two issues, we list out two research directions.
		NLP
		Statistical arbitrage.

	---> what assumption or intention is the application for?
	---> implementation of networks !!!!!
	---> what kind of analysis needed to be performed !!!!

! mask: 1 if data there, 0 if data not there
? How does workflow look like when we directly predict? What are we predicting?
? what is the ultimate goal?
? deep learning how to make comparison? accuracy? 


Recurrent neural networks for multivariate time series with missing values, Zhengping Che
	(1087/1105)
	(Cited by MRNN as 25, Cited by Naomi as 6, cited by chengxian as Che)

	(focus: assumed missing, GRU-D with masking and time interval (to represent missing chunk)
	
	
	
	
	(opinion on the other side: does not capture the missing data pattern themselves as we impute and downstream model can only see the "full" series)
	(also, extra assumptions, 1. small rate of missing, missing at random, 2. computationally expensive)

	obj min loss(target, cross_section(target, horizontal))
	architecture
		cross_section -- feedforward
		horizontal: non-identity ---- BiRNN
	look at code

Use it to predict the type/sector of stock?

time series used: 
1. is it irregular
2. the type of data

[0Next NLP]
	in actually helping trading, need a prototype to proceed --> i.e. those paper that contain an application example, not just an architecture.
[0Next statistical arbitrage]
	external seek, paper/prof/prof's stu/thesis, and prepare to actually trBde, focus on actually tradable ones if possible

	ASK chris, ok we are learning all theories about no-arbitrage, but then we are trying to do arbitrage right? then why do we need to learn all these? But then should I read books/courses in financial economics?
	ASK chris, what broker does he use to access market? IBKR?
