What is the difference between rl and control system? How about stochastic rl? What is bandit?
rl I get reward from env, I myself have a Q estimate, now I update myself and take next action based on \epsilon greedy policy
linear control, Yes. I have error as well. Now my action (u) is simply a predefined equation.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller
What is bandit problem? What tradeoff does it signify? 

put strike -> can sell at ...
option hedge: avoid large loss by offset   your success.
policy = control eqn (this makes the main difference as we manually write in the control eqn)
env = plant
agent = controller
difference between reward and estimated reward = e
action = u

I do not see myself as someone who has to focus on and sharpen a single subject. Instead, I clearly understand that how fast the dynamics of the market can be. If everyone only focus on what he/she is used to, the company will have to spend a lot in order to gather enough manpower to accompluh its goals.

Some people may wish to  stay in and sharpen their comfort zone, for example, math-heavy analysis. but I clearly know that from a managerial perspective, this is hardly possible due to the dynmmics of the market.

For example, if one day the company needs someone to fix the infrastcture, I am willing to grab the relevant skills. If one day the company needs someone to assist the sales, I am willing to save the company the cost of extra labors as well.
whatever it takes to facilitate the communications among my colleagues and managers.
regardless whether it is mathematics-related or not.

From what I currently understnad, this job is somethingt hat require cooperations from multiple groups of people. Hence BUt the distinct background of each group may prevent smooth communication. By advancing my interdisciplnay knowledge through practices, I can pontially reduces the loads of my managers and colleagues amd accelerate the companies' projects.

### There is no free lunch, including data mining itself.
### If you cannot beat quant trading firms, join and learn from them.

### implment force replay

The existence of various quant trading firms makes mining itself more expensive in terms of both money and time. So the best strategy is, if you cannot beat them, try to join them. 

Patterns in free data either do not exist or are time-consuming to mine as the low hanging fruit are gone. 
x1_B ---> h(x,y)

We have 
\int x1_{y \in B} P_{x,y}(dx \times dy)
\int x P_x(dx) \int 1_{y \in B} P_y(dy)

additivity of both probability measure and area

Tonelli stuff E(inf sum) = inf sum(E)
E(X_n) = p_n

1. E(...) < \infty implies
P(.. = \infty) = 0

2. hence P( .. < \infty) = 1
but .. < \infty implies sequence to 0
hence P(... to 0)  =1

### why is crypto decentralized?
### need to trigger review?
### how archi design?
	when to short -> nn(data (e.g. RSI) from other idx)
	risk mgmt: sharpe decide how target is fed
	Tokyo (+9) -> Hongkong (+8) -> London (0) -> NYSE (-4)
### quant proj
	0. add /content/drive/My drive
	1. day rather than minutes, check those repo
### adb silent phone notification (and reanble)
before/after?

### tailor to the industry/job ----> terminology quant modeling/risk management require
teaching -> leardership and swap with competition
---> double-emphasize python ---> CV

### what is arma-garch an can we incorporate it with RNN? When do we use arma vs arima?


### append store balance, pos_changed

only within 3 years as source node, say

people/review -> network of people/sub-review
	 -> paper with what you think to be useful
	 
	 
### is there any relationship between LSTM and ARIMA? both seem to have state space update.
