--------------200C hw6 p1, PID iff every submodule of free module is free	
every ideal is a submodule of the free module R by definition. principal ideal (exclude 0 ideal) is isomorphic to the module R itself by multiplication map.

Ideal cannot contain more than 1 linearly indepdent generator, hence it can never contain a submodule of R \oplus R.



-------------Qual FA20 P6, tensor product, sum rules, field
basis are linearly indepedent, linearly independent can be extended into a basis
Whenever we are in a vector space, we always PICK a basis. If we are given some l.i. set, then we EXTEND it into a basis. (Then possibly using tensor sum rules)



-------------------
\psi \to \psi^2 automorphism need not to have order 3 (i.e. it need not to be the "2" in the cyclic group of automorphism. automorphim order can only be known through powering test

e,g. in 7th primitive 
1. \sigma -> \sigma^2 has order 3 as 2^3 mod 7  = 1
2. \sigma -> \sigma^3 has order 6 as 3^6 mod 7 = 2^3 mod 7 = 1



the element $\sum_{g \in G} g(\gamma)$ is an element fixed by any $g \in G$. Hence now just prove this element have 
    1.  satisfy polynomial of index order
    2. that polynomial is irreducible (and hence is the minimal polynomial)
    
then the group corresponding field is $F(\sum_{g \in G} g(\gamma))$ (also normal to normal, can be verified through splitting fields of the min polynomial)






-------------------------
If we drop down the top field, min polynomial does not change. If we lift up the base field, the min polynomial may become reducible and thus the new min polynomial is an irreducible factor of it.

each divisor has a unique cyclic subgroup (hence collect \phi(d) generators), now sum them all up must equal to total number of elements (i.e. n). THere \sum_{d|n} \phi(d) = n

splitting field 
     equal to base field exten all roots of the polynomial
     if of an irreducible, then normal extension

finite field
    cyclic group structure, if the base extend the gneerator of it (which will satisfy a min polynomial of roder $n$), then it will extend to the super field
    galois fundamental + cylic group structure -> implication about subfield structure/irreducible factor of x^{p^n}-x
    uniqueness and spltting field of x^{p^n}-x
    
    

i.e. extesion degree = min polynomial degree = (in finite field) the exponent in number of element

-------------------
compositum, primitive element theorem, may relate to the quotient F[x]/(f)
isomorphic (as K-vector space) if and only if same degree. BUt isomorphic as rings (K-algebra) or field, you may need to consider CRT. Think about Q[SQRT(2)] and Q[Sqrt{3}]


hence irreducible polynomial also related to F[x]/(irreducible) iff field and CRT (which requires separable??? or as long as it is irreducible factors??)


F[x]/(f) \cong \prod_i F[x]/(f_i)
where each f_i is a irreducible factor of f in $F[x]$ (hence expression derived from crt (i.e. the one on the right hand side) can change when we change F. (The more we lift F, the more split and in splitting field, everything beceoms singleton)

compositum always require super field (or automatically by algebraic closore if both are algebraic


------------------------------


    



------------------------chinese remainder theorem, minimal polynomials
coprime if and only if gcd=1 (which is satisfied for any two pair of irreducible)

note that we are always in PID as our coefficient set is a field, min polynomial is exactly defined as the generaotor of the ideal {p | p(a) = 0}. Hence if there are two, one must be in the ideal of another. (Can also argue through euclidean algorithm)

----------residue theorems on C \cup \infty
residue on riemann sphere sum to 0. Hence when \infty is included in the domain (i.e. riemann sphere), outer sum residue equals to inner sum residue for any contour.

Alternatively, Res(f(z)dz, \infty) = Res(-f(1/z)(1/z^2)dz, 0) eqn
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_at_infinity
allow us to directly compute out of contour residue and get in contour residue indirectly

residue at some point is always assocaited with a circle around it small enough such that it is the only pole in the circle.

((a-b)^p = a^p - b^p in finite field. Hence anything of the form x^p-a

F \subseteq F^p means any b can be expressed as a^p, which in turn means frobenius auto is surjective

field extension: can pick a basis. if we alwready have l.i set, can extend to a basis

any k[x] is an PID, hence irreducible generate maximal ideal, hence quotient out by it gives a field
irreducible
if reducible, can find irreducible factor with a strictly smaller degree (and hence extend to that degree by taking a root of that factor). Note any irreducible factor still have coefficient (in particular, constant coefficient) in the base field (by definition)

    note c^n = z^p, where z is the constant coeff because
        1. !!! constant coeff is the product of all root
        2. each root to the pth power is c (and there are a total of n of them in this irreducible factor)
 (given irreducible factor has n roots)

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/403924/xp-c-has-no-root-in-a-field-f-if-and-only-if-xp-c-is-irreducible

hence constant coeff has two properties
1. product of roots
2. in base field

!!! union of ideal in general is NOT an ideal. But since we are in a chain, x \in I_1, y \in I_2, but either I_1 \subseteq I_2 or vice versa and hence union is an ideal here.

primitive element theorem (so that we deal with root instead of entire field, if you transform hte root to anywhere, then )
field automorphisms reduces to root automorphism (and vice versa) through primitive element theorem. (i.e. given field automorphism f: F[a] -> F[f(a)], if there is another auto $g(a)=f(a)$ that fix F. then f=g


??? F(a) -> F(b) how do we know that f(a) is a primitve element though?

once we choose a->a', we can restrict it to an isomorphism F[a]-> F[a']
the isomorphism sending a->a' is unique (i.e. once we define a and a', the isomorphism is fully determiend), by there exists, we can find an automorphism such that retricting it to src field gives exactly this isomophism

isomorphism ---> F[a] -> F[f(a)]
F[a] -> F[b] ---> unique isomorphism such that f(a) = b

passing through polynomial to show that they are conjugate root. 
Then by the same isomorphism extension theorem

!!!! can always shift the function by a constant, can always shift its real/imaginary by a cosntant, the function laways remain holomorphic

!!! need to state mmp when want to use boundary bound to imply itnerior bound

!!! get rid of extra term in computing order (e.g. constant term or polynomial terms)

suppose k = lim loglog(M)/log(R)
then lim R^k = lim logM
hence there exists an \epsilon such that logM \leq R^{k +\epsilon}
now plug back
if we have 
k
\leq lim loglog(M+R^a)/logR 
\leq lim log(logR + R^{k +\epsilon})/logR 
\leq log(R^{k +2\epsilon})/logR 
= k +2\epsilon
now psuh \epsilon \to 0
!!! note that there always exists R large enough such that LogR \leq R^{\epsilon} from then on

!!! special integral that back relate, check if it had appeared in 220B final p6
|f(z)-f(0)| = z\int_0^1 f'(tz)dt
to prove it, substitute RHS x=tz and note that z is a constant with respect to the integral, we will end up in the fundamental theorem of calculus form

    if no guarantee on f(0), think about whether we can shift f(0) to 0 (unless codmain has restriction, this can work while preserving holomorphi)
    once we do that, |f(z)| can be bounded by |z||f'(tz)|, compact set helps bound |z|, |f'(tz)| is the values on the line from  0 to z and hence can be bounded by boundary + mmp or uniformly bounded from montel
    
    guarantee holomorphic/order/primitive/harmo-holo connection (imaginary constant)

    f \leq g for all z, then ord(f) \leq ord(g) (whether g is an entire fucntion or bound does not matre, an inequality on function f always produce an inequality on ord(f))
    
    rank implies we have a constant sequence to hold that condition, for stuff like log(n), we CAN have a weierstrass factorization, but its rank in \infty
    
    review 1. log derivative argument 2. weierstrass factorization for sin/cos
    
    !!! we acan reverse use, once we decide the order (if easy to do), we can know that rank \leq order, hence weierstrass factorization condition must be satisfied when we plug in order as rank (as anything than rank plug in will converge)

    cauchy: element of order $p$ exists, hence any group, any prime divisor of the group emits a cyclic group of that order
    
    p^n sylow group always exists (sylow theorem)

     quotient of abelian is always abelian, hence given G_i/G_{i-1} abelian
     any normal intermediate group is G_i/K is G_i/G_{i-1}})/(K/G_{i-1}).and therefore is also abelian, allowing us to continue the series
     hence we can choose whatever factor we want, as long as we keep normality
        e.g. when we choose the entire, we basically prove that abelian implies nilpotent
        e.g. when we choose cylic factor, we have a supersolvabe series

    2. use as the reverse of cauchy estimate (i.e. given bound f back from f' as long as the set is compact)

commutator in a self subgroup (including self) guarantee self to be normal (so that central series condition automatically guarantee our pullback in central series are still normal in G, AND G_i normal in our pullback)

proving equality between something and a product factorization f = prod


0. show product actualy converges (through \sum(...) implies \prod(1+...) and bound 

0!!! DO NOT think of weierstrass factorization, that is for construction (not proving equality)

1. check if they have the same zero (counting multiplicty), if they are f = e^hprod for some h
2,  now try to show h = 0
    1. first show h' = 0 (and therefore h = c) through logarithmic derivative
    f -> f'/f
    e^h -> h'
    z^m -> m/z
    constant (factor) -> nothing
    \prod f_i -> \sum f_i'/f_i (e.g. 1-(z/a)^2 -> 2z/(z^2-k^2)
    
    cot(\pi a) formula
    
     + log(\prod)' --> note the log(\prod) becomes a sum, and we just take derivative of each term
    
    2. 
        1. if we have no zero at origin, we take z=0 (or any convenient value) and plug into f = e^c prod to show c=0
        2. if we do have a zero at origin, divide LHS and RHS by the z^.. component, then evaluare at 0. (e.g. sin(\pi)/\piz -> 1, and hopefully \prod without z^ component -> 1 as well

    = E_1(z/a)E_1(-z/a)



alwayys use multiplicative notation in src, as in target, automorphism combines through composition (hence using multiplcaition in src grup makes it less confusing)


each generator and each target form a relation in the final presentation. (that once we decide generators' target the semidirect homomorphism is unique, (and only until that it is unique)
    which is why we have aca^{-1} = c^{-1} AND bcb^{-1} = c^{-1} in that stackexchange question
    
    src automorphism, a pre network layer before the homomorphism layer, that swap src generator around (while still maintaining the same semi-direct). Hence if we have two homo, we can try to find a premap layer so that they are equal, then they are isomorphic)
    
    

!!! check correctness


    given original wf form, we can  use order (and only order!!) to (show equality)
    1. get a sequence that satisfy weierstrass factorization (need to argue that plug in a greater value than rank still ensure convergence as |a_n| \to \infty and have sufficiently large N such that n >= N implies |a_n| >=1
    
    
    (i.e. order, derivative/LHP, ODDNESS can help constrain a WF form, in particular, ODDNESS/EVENNESS can help evaluation when we do not have convenient pt to eval other than 0)
    2. hence we get some form of WF 
        1. multiplcity at 0
        2. \prod E_p(z/a_n), where p is the order
        3. e^h
        
        now function derivative tells us multiplicty at 0
        
        now odd function -> E_p split into E_p(z/a_n)E_p(-z/a_n) (and multiply together to see the result form 1-(z/a_n)^2)
        
        
        why does he say discard zeros??
        
        order tells us max degree of h and hence write it as polynomial (za+b)
        LHP (or direct eval if there is no 0 at origin) tells us the constant part of the polynomial b
        oddness tells us a=0
    
    
    2. constrain e^.. to be polynomual
        then use LHP (if zeros at origin) and evaluation to further constrain its coefficient



??? ompute order from taylor
    for sufficiently large n (or r), we can use \epsilon argument to remove the lim (technically lim's definition is that), u+\epsilon \geq or u-\epsilon \leq (two versions)
    
    connection derivative value, coefficient and order (bound), use cauchy estimate) 

    when we are given a subfield, we can extend isomorphism, or take a look at its normal closure
        
    that's when there are more than one cyclic group of the smae size (which is not possible wif the aut subgroup is cyclic itself). If that does happen, if we can find $f$ post -processing layer via conjugation $fAut(N)f^{-1}$ can help us go from one target to another, then they are isomorphic
    
    now if there are multiple src generator and multiple target, 
        note that trivial is never a target (or infact any automorphism in the center of Aut), once mapped, any conjugation will make it remain trivial. which is also why we do not need to consider it when we only have one target of that order
        
        multiple generator (AND they have to be in the same order)
        a valid target is only a target whose order divides the src generator order. Hence say we have order2 and order3 generator and one target for each of them, we are still in unique generator unique target case (rather than multiple multiple case). But in case we are in multiple multiple, we need to try pre-processing, post-processing AND any combination of pre-processing and post-processing.
        
        technically need to chek the entire group map is consistent after shuffling, but C_2 \times C_2 case is easy, as there are only one target, and we have (target, trivial, target)
        
        ????? how about C_4 -> C_4 case?
        
given a homomorphism like in semi, it fully decides once we deccide where the generator is mapped to. Hence when the target is unique (i.e. there is only one element of order 2), the entire homomorphism is unique and we need not bother using isomorphic rules
rules only used when we have multiple generators or/and multiple targets
    1. multiple generator, unique target. Then one generator is mapped to the target and rest mapped to trivial automorphism. Then src shuffling rule as long as we can always shuffle one gen to another.
    2. single generator multiple target...????
    3. multiple generator, multiple target
        
        
        
        
        cauchy estimate holds for any R. Hence we are allowed to choose R_n to cancel terms in n
        inequality direction does not change when we push \epsilon to 0

        !!! powering test -> exponent a^a^a
        !!!! reduction exponent mod [element group size]
        
        
        !!! composition multiply exponent
        !!! powering test, powering -> multiply exponent till it mod original size = 1 (i.e. a->a^k, then smallest m such that k^m = k*k*k*....*k (total m times) such that mod size = 1)
        
        !!! order of element is through (a^k)(a^k)...(a^k) = a^{mk}, we find the smallest m such that mk mod size = 0
        !!! (i.e. in addition notation, we add for element addition (identity 0), multiply for automorphism composition (identity 1)
            in multiplicative notation, we add exponent for element multiplication (identity 0), aply k times become multiply by k
            multiply exponent for automorphism composition (identity 1), apply k tmes become exponetiate by k
        
        
        hence if target group is ablian, then post-processng layer has no effect and we do not need to consider it.
            given all target of suitable order, we only need to consider those that generate different group?
            ??? check example groups???? to verify target??? from homework??
            two target are the same if they generate the same group????
            two src are the same if they generate the asme group (i.e. only one generator is needed)
        
        
        note that |c_n| -> 0 and hence for sufficiently large n, -log(|c_n|) is POSITIVE
        but this also means
            a > b ---> log(a) > log(b)
            a > b ---> -log(a) < -log(b)   (hence be careful of what is positive what is negative in inequality???)
        
        
        
        the condition is 
            1. generator map decide the entire map
            2. if the entire map are identical up to pre-processing and post-processing layer, then they are isomorphic
            
            
            generator swap is sufficient for multi-src case, 
            if \phi(a) = c and \phi(b)=d
            suppose we also have f(a) = d and f(b) = c
            and after swapped by some k such that f \circ k = g and g(a) = c g(b) = d
            then since g is an homomorphism!!!!, the rest of g must be the same as \phi
            
            hence if map to another target, find who is amp to the original target in current map. (call it m)
            then find an auto from generator to m and we solve the problem

    M(R) has two way (by its sup definition
        1. |f(z)| \leq M(R) for all z in radius R (caucy estimate direction)
        2. if(z)| \leq K for all z (e.g. a bound on taylor series), then M \leq K
        
            1. through FTC (for first derivative)
            2. through bound on taylor series  (for coeff)
        
        1. when there is only one n term, use R_n to cancel all $n$ just make sure n \to \infty$ implies R_n \to \infty as well, then push R_n \to \infty
        2. when there is a series of n term, cut into two series in terms of n=some expresison of R. Then bound each of them separately 
        
        but now we can obtain order from either derivative or its taylor series coeffs

        it is always select the generatro $g$ from src group, map to an automorphism whose order divides $g$'s order. Now we may have multiple generator of maximum order an they can replace $g$, that is where the isomorphic semidirect product comes in
        
        grab a target generator and generate the whole group and list each one's order?
        the collection of zeros of the product simply comes from all factors (counting multiplicities)

gen->gen, (x -> x^k such that gcd(k,n) = 1, which is why there are \phi(n) automorphisms) this required, otherwise it is not an Aut(Z_n)
now to compute the order k^k^k....till it beceoms 1 mod n (e.g. 10^10 mod 11 = 1 and hence n -> n^10 is an auto with order 2 in the Aut group, representing the element 2)
    i.e. WARNING order of auto has NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER with the exponent we start with
    !!! although if we want an order 2 automorphism, we can always x -> x^{-1}
    !!
        1. decide possible size of embedding image, such size has to both divide \phi(n) by lagrange and divide the size of our src group. for each size, there will be a unique cyclic subgroup as we know the structure of AUt(C_n) = C_{\phi(n)}
        2. for each szie from step 1, find a generator automorphism of that order, say \phi(n) = n^m
        ??? what to quotient???
        
        3. for that size, select an element with order |src|/SIZE (and hence the quotient is of size |SIZE|)
        
        
        3. now presentation relation will be \phi_h(n) = hnh^{-1} = n^m, where h is the generator of (our src/kernel)
    
Hnece to find an automorphism with order of sth, we have to do test and trial through each possible automorphism

H->H auto: composing is enough as the src are elements, hene automorphism preserve their orders
Au(N) -> Aut(N) auto: conjugate composing is required, otherwise direct composing will change the target automorphism order of each element, which is bad. (but conjugate autm by auto preserve the order of the original auto)

Remember apply \phi(k) = k^6 twice we get k^36 not k612. Hence for order 2 amp in C_11, it is \phi(k) = k^10 = k^{-1}


isomorphic pair of root must in the same irreducible factor through p(\phi(a)) = \phi(p(a)) = \phi(0) = 0
thus once we get an auto from a to \phi(a), it is an extension of \phi(a)

similarly given ay two root in irreducible factor must have an automorphism (by transitive action property), although it is not needed here.


when we compute order, we NEED a bound on circle of radius R, NOT A POINT. Hence use cauchy estimate like the following:
    Take M(R+1)
    Now for any point within radius R, construct a radius 1 circle and compute cauchy
    you get |f'(z)}| \leq M(R+1) for all z and hence M'(R) \leq M(R+1)


conjugate composition of automorphism does not change derivative (i.e. f'(a) = \phi'f'\phi^{-1}')
    it can be verified through f \circ f^{-1} = id and hence f'f^{-1}' = 1



1. merge top (to show middle field isomorphism can be extended)
2. merge bottom
3. merge both (to impy transitive action)
