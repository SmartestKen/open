earn through
	1. current price sell, lower price buy
	2, current price buy, higher price sell
	
	(i.e. regardless of time order, buy in price MUST be lower than sell-out price)
	
	!!! For example, we obtain an arbitrage if we can buy an option that agrees to buy in a lower price, OR sell it at a higher prie in the future

	!!! For example, shorting when predicting stock price drop, bull when predicting price will increase


capital/equity market
	stock (we py to buy share, then if share price rises we can sell to earn profit, or we just use these to control company's operation through voting)
	bond (we pay to buy bond, then bond will pay back regular interest and principal at the end)
derivative market (based on price of something else, utilize time difference)
	future (obligation in future)
	option (right, but not obligation in future)
		call -> buy later
		put --> sell later
		strike --> pre-specified price at buying/selling
		
			(i.e. we can choose to let it delivers (we buy) at any time at the fixed price, if that fixed price is lower, then it equals t we buy in at a lower price, we then immediately sell it at current price to earn the profit.), although the price difference will be deducted by the premium cost the beginning (which is charged for the RIGHT of doing all these actions)
			
			if we cannot earn, we just let the contract expire and loses our premium (it will not force us to buy in at a higher price)
securities
	equity -->???
	debt ---> bond/certificates of deposit
	first purchaser (without selling in the middle): bond interst fixed (a.k.a fixed income), can only be dangerous if the corpporate/country breaks down and unable to pay back
	sell before maturity:
	interest rate inversely correlate to bond price (the higher rate, people care less about your existing bond, hence if you want to sell it, you sell it at a lower price than its face value, and hence lose money)
	similarly you earn if 
		the interest goes down
		you sell your existing bond
		
low price  -> no one want to sell/supply it. Everyone wants to buy/demand it
high price -> the other way
hence equilibrium of supply and demand exist at certain price

(R_i -R_f)/(R_m - R_f) = \beta_i

after offseted by risk-free return rate, how much we gain from investment/how much we gain without investment = \beta_i
Hence if investment is riskier than what we already have (our current portofilo), then \beta_i > 1. If it makes our portofolio safer, then \beta_i < 1
(Hence the riskier, the higher the return of the to-be-added stock should be) 

offset to account for time value of money. i.e. buying T-bill is like we just put the money there and how much "profit" it will gain naturally as time goes
price fltuation --> supply and demand flutuation

risk-free rate (of return)
	usually take interest rate of 3 omnth T-bill, used as offset

multiple (product/stock) is less risky than a single (product/stock)
speculation ~ close to gamble		
portofolio
	collection of securities

!!! generally risk-free factor
market( existing portfolio) return is fixed across all the stocks we want to add)


E --> average over all possibilities (i.e. turn an random variable expression into a sum expression)
auto-covariance mat --> when we have more than 2 variable, then (i,j) is the cov of X_i and X_j (hence vairance of each on the diagonal)
cross_covariance mat --> when we have two random vectors, hence may not be square matrix



when we talk about variance of random vector x, we mean either
	\Sigma (Cov) matrix
	w^T\Sigma_x w, where w is our distribution of initial fund
	
	by back derivation, w^T\Sigma_x w = Var(w^Tx)
	
	use traiditional formula to derive thing above

Var = E((x-\mu)^2) = E(x^2) - \mu^2
Cov = E((x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)) = E(xy) - \mu_x\mu_y

Cov_{i,j} = Cov(X_i, X_j)
Cov = E((X-\mu(X))(Y-\mu_Y)^T)

white noise.
	1. cross product of dominant and error_i has zero cov
	2. cross product of error_i and error_j has zero cov as well



brownian motion
reflection principle

central limit theorem

what technique needed, just understand those technique.

space  ---> all outcomes
collection of measurable set ---> collection of event (each is a set of outcomes)
measure ---> probability functionn
metric
set of random variables
state (a.k.a label/value) space/measure

random variable is then a measurable function mapping outcomes to value (i.e. preimage of measurale set is measurable, hence e.g. the preimage of {outcome: X(outcome) = 1} is measurable and tehrefore has a probability)

distribution: a function that evaluates to the preimage measure at any given state

!!! outcomes space is not necessarily a coordinate space (in fact it is usually not), hence cannot directly add a coordinate t. We can only say a set of random variable indexed by t


X is F measurable means the coarest \sigma-algebra generated by X is a subalgebra of F


M_t = sup B(s) represent the minimum time B(s) hits anything
B can become smaller, but M will not

1. axis mapping
	real coeff real -> real
	the other axis -> circle
	but then circle -> other axis
2. 5 pt drawing (i.e. draw coordinate, then write values 1,-1,i,-i,0 map to near those points)	
	!!! first decide boundary using what we get from 1, then use extra pt
	
	half plane decision
		1. boundary can map to either axis or circle. Hence target can be either half plane, disk or outside of disk
		2. now use one of extra pt (1,-1,i,-i) to decide
		
	quadrant decision
		1. boundary will always include part of an axis and part of a circle, hence target will always be a half circle
		2. now use conformal mapping angle rule
	
	disk decision
		1. boundary will map to an axis, hence the target can only be half plane
		2. now use 0 to decide
		
	
	half disk decision
		1. boundary will can either include (part of two axis), or include (an axis and part of circle), hence target can either be quadrant or half circle
		2. now use conformal mapping angle rule

f(kz): pull back domain of f
	!!! in that montel problem, we basically fix a domain of z and forward it to the domain of f. (unlike in transformation, where we have fixed domain of f and pullback to some other domain)

every theorem has holomorphic within ...
many theorem has boudnary condition
zero+sequnece of function -> hurwitz (no zero at boundary of the chosen compact set)

infinite sequence in comapct set must converge (related to identity theorem as well)

the formula version for coeff soes not have n!

probability generating function
	probability of something happen at t=k (multiplied by t^k)
	its self product is probability of sometihing happen twice at t=k
	multiply z = shift time coordinate backwards by 1, (i.e. add an empty timestep)
	
	resolve the generating fucntion from recurrence relation into explicit form will give us all the coeff (i.e. the exact probability)


!! when dealing with last two pt in five pt map, you will get things like \pi/4 and 3\pi/4
!! i.e. a permutation between real axis/img axis and unit circle, in complex coeff, when you plug in another complex coeff, the numerator AND the denominator can both pull out i and therefore cancel each other. Hence real coeff (real -> real), img coeff (img -> real)

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/312474/what-is-it-meant-with-the-sigma-algebra-generated-by-a-random-variable
i.e. it includes preimage of any measurable set in the rv's state space

the less set, the smaller the union
the less set, the bigger the intersection

union appear in at least one
intersection appear in all





BC Lemma
if a sequence of event E_n has finite probability sum, then limsup E_n, the set of  outcomes that appear infinitely many times in E_n, has 0 probability (i.e. almost never)

conversely, if E_n are independent and have infinite probability sum, then the limsup has 1 probability (i.e. almost surely)
